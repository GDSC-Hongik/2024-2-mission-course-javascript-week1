    <p> ◦ I am highly interested in education and have been teaching students continuously since graduating from high
        school.</p>
    <p> ◦ I love cats, but unfortunately, I'm allergic to them. Despite that, I have long-term experience volunteering
        at a stray cat shelter (with a mask, of course).</p>
